Boys don´t cry
Anitta

(Who says boys don't cry?)

Sometimes I call you when I can't sleep
Alone
Now you keep asking me what that means
Oh, no

In your feelings
I can feel it you're in your feelings
You won't admit it, but
That's why I push you away from me
'Cause I know, I know

It drives you crazy, tried to tame me
But nobody's taking control over me

Ooh, baby, baby, you've been talking tough
But you boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?

Ooh, baby, baby, you just oughta touch
'Cause you boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?

Sometimes you call me when you're too drunk
Oh, God
Then you start telling me I'm the one
I'm not

In your feelings
I can feel it you're in your feelings
You won't admit it, but
I thought that we was just having fun
'Cause I know, I know

It drivеs you crazy, tried to tame me
But nobody's taking control ovеr me

Ooh, baby, baby, you've been talking tough
But you boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?

Ooh, baby, baby, you just oughta touch
'Cause you boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?
